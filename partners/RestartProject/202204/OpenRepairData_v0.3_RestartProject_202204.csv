Further checks showed it only did straight stitch. The straight stitching also had tangles. So 3 problems to solve!!To investigate further, covers were removed. Just take care at this point as mains voltages may be exposed - think safety and disconnect from mains before removing covers.Problem 1: Straight stitch only was down to ""sticky"" oil preventing the needle left/right mechanism engaging correctly.""Sticky"" oil generally indicates the wrong oil has been used at some time, don't use 3in1, WD40 or anything other than sewing machine oil - a one ounce bottle will cost a couple of pounds and will always be useful if you intend to maintain the machine yourself.Cleaning the ""sticky"" oil requires some patience, meths and cotton buds to slowly clean and free the mechanism. You may need to repeat once or twice to finally clean the bad oil out. Once the mechanism is moving relatively freely, apply som sewing machine oil (just a small drop will do). DON'T be tempted to take things apart, remove grub screws or anything else because unless you understand what you are doing you may completely mess up the timing and your machine will not work without being correctly retimed.Cleaned and oiled, zig zag stitching worked  OKProblem 2: tangles during stitching. Well probably a classic issue here. The most important part of your machine is often the overlooked one - the needle!These poor things get used, abused and are still expected to work. In reality a needle lasts for around 6-8hrs of use before it becomes blunt and should be replaced. Add to that the occasional catching for whatever reason on the foot plate and needle bend, get ""stubbed"" ends that catch on the cotton and yes if you buy cheap you often get cheap, rough poor quality needles that are not fit for purpose. Good brands such a Singer, Schmetz are worth the extra cost and will be reliable.""stubbed"" ends will catch cotton and cause tangles"

A screw accessible from behind the back panel and two under the two steam control buttons which needed to be removed first, allows the top panel on the handle to be removed revealing the two control boards marked with stickers with part numbers. One controller board with an LCD panel and rubberised buttons and one relay and transistor control board. Both are contained in their own plastic housing which were sealed and potted with rubber sealent to maintain as water proofed.Everything in this iron was a bit of a surprise (compared with other cheaper irons i've worked on) the unit was very well constructed and I don't think I've ever seen and item so well built for repairability, everything was connected via removable plugs and sockets or terminal blocks. There was even easy access to the hot plate with a bit more deconstruction.Further testing both powered (under caution) and unpowered showed the hotplate was ok, the LCD control system was ok, all the circuitry received power, but power was not delivered back to the hot plate via the relay in the relay control board, making that the primary suspect.Searching online revealed a telephone number for spare parts for Russell Hobbs UK customer and technical service help and spare parts line and also for a third party supplier Partsmaster. Both were able to supply consumables such as filters for the steam chamber or even a new power flex but Russell Hobbs said the unit was now obsolete and they did not provide controller spare parts for that iron.

Always worth checking each winding resistance with a meter on ohms range (ensure no power connected first!). All windings should show a very similar resistance, sometimes one winding (or several) may be a quite different lower resistance indicating shorted windings, or a short circuit (0 ohms) or open circuit.Tip: If windings seem OK, it's worth checking all connections and switch with meter set to ohms range (again ensure no power connected first!) and cleaning paper particles out. Motor windings can look overheated but may still work and cleaning will reduce overheating. Shredders do get hammered!!Don't forget that PAT test before returning to the owner, think safe.Roger"

Diagnosis:  It was charging 20 mA, which looked like it was fully charged and trickle charging. It wasn’t recognised by a laptop (nothing appeared on the USB) so it was not a case of it being switched on with a dead screen. We tried all the Android resetting key combinations we could find with no effect. Accessing the battery requires taking out the (broken) screen and a mid plate. The phone is under warranty but Samsung refused to repair it under warranty as the screen is broken on the sides and would shatter when opening the phone.  Owner was going to check with Lovephone."

Parts of the PCB WILL be at mains or even higher voltages and capacitors may hold high voltages even when mains is disconnected.Tips for checking switched mode power supply:- Remove mains first and leave for 10-15mins to allow capacitors to discharge OR if you know how to safety check with a multimeter then proceed.- flatten a clean staple free cardboard box to lay the TV screen down on - this makes it easy to move the TV around during the investigations and also keeps the screen protected from scratches. - Remove the back keeping screws safely in a pot - you may need to remove the stand / wall brackets first.- Identify the switched mode power supply PCB - it's usually quite easy as it will have transformers, capacitors and other larger components some with heatsinks. The PCB should be marked with warnings such as ""HOT"" or ""DANGER"" and there may well be a white hatched area - this indicates mains voltages present.- be aware some metal parts may still have residual voltages present - check with you multimeter on volts range.- check the board for clues such as overheating, fuses that have blown etc. Semiconductors such as diodes / FETs can fail and crack or show small holes. If this is visible you can identify and replace such components (easily said, not always so easy to do!) OR simply purchase a replacement board of the same type and version.In this particular case, I found two failed diodes marked Q165A (full device type is RBQ10B65A) - they were short circuit. I replaced them with similar higher spec devices Vishay 12CWQ10FN and the TV worked fine.- If nothing obvious is found check other boards for faults -was the TV dropped? has it been given a hard life? Many faults I find in electronic equipment are mechanical - worn switch, mechanically poor connector mountings causing broken PCB connections or lift"

The standby switch had not been working for a while so the owner had turned the TV on/off using the mains socket switch. This was described as sometimes working but if it did not then the mains socket switch would be turned on/ff several times to persuade the TV to turn on. Eventually the TV failed to turn on at all.OK, the first point to make here is that turning on/off several times at the mains socket switch is not recommended. The issue is that it probably overstresses the TV power supply and other components which will have to deal with repeated inrush/outrush currents. The standby switch on any device will turn it on and off in a more controlled manner. Anyway lets explain this fix.Warning: TVs contain switched mode power supplies so unless you understand the basics of how they work and particularly the risks do not mess with them. Parts of the PCB WILL be at mains or even higher voltages and capacitors may hold high voltages even when mains is disconnected.First step was to disconnect from the mains for safety, then remove the back to expose the circuit boards. Looking at the standby switch, the plastic button had partly broken and it no longer reliably operated the PCB mounted on/off switch. This was fixed by placing a small piece of heatshrink tubing around the switch to guide the damaged button to the correct place. The button now functioned and the familiar quiet operating click could be heard.Next the TV was powered on. The button functioned but the TV would not turn and remained in standby. Time to get the multimeter out to check voltages on the standby switch. This appeared to work correctly. After tracing the on/off signal back to the switched mode power supply board (take care, high voltages here!) it seemed the signal was not getting through to enable the power supplies.Fortunately the connector functions were marked on the PCB and it was easy to work out which pin enabled the power supply.Now a little trick to check power sup"

First comment is that these are dangerous with high voltages on exposed parts (300-400V and sometimes higher so if you do not understand how they work and cannot identify danger areas DO NOT DABBLE!!Second comment is that this repair is not something to do at a repair cafe event unless you can guarantee no-one but yourself can touch anything either accidentally or deliberately.I took the chassis home:- step 1, get the service manual- step 2, clean the dust off and check correct valves in place and look for failed components - old capacitors are typical failures. They become leaky and loose their capacitance.All seemed remarkably well given the age!One valve was incorrect and removed. This left 2 missing valves. They were in fact the push pull audio output stage valves type HN309. These are somewhat unusual as they have a 12.6V heater - my hunch is that they were used in old valve car radios operating from a 12V battery. HN309 are triode/pentodes (2 valves in one) and like rocking horse you know what to find but after some investigation I found a very similar type LN309 and further cross referencing identified a more common PCL83 as a potential alternative after comparing specs (see here at the Valve Museum for valve information  http://www.r-type.org/)- step 3, Decided to fit a modern mains lead - the old leads were not in a good state.- step 4, I performed a 250V insulation test on the mains transformer and also between primary and secondary windings (looking for breakdown of the enamel coating on windings) - all was well. In this case I repeated at 500V and again all was well. Also checked mains switch wiring was working using a multimeter switched to measure resistance. Again all was well, particularly no shorts. - step 5, I decided to switch on!! even with 2 valves missing. Switching on was performed at the mains socket, with the unit on/off switch already set to on.No nast"

When switching on the record player, placing a record on the turntable, and switching it down to 'Start' or 'Auto' mode, the pickup (reading) arm was supposed to automatically swing into position and the disc to begin spinning, but this did not happen. Opening up the case, we found that the motor was spinning freely when the switch was in the 'Stop' position, but then appeared to slowly and unevenly judder around in steps when the other switch positions applied a clutch to the motor. With all of the system consisting of just one motor and a highly complex assembly of mechanical/clockwork/transmission parts, we could not identify the fault after an hour, with no online help available for this decades-old piece of tech, and suspected that finding the faulty component would require spending all day dismantling and studying the mechanism."

Another restarter had attempted to open the radio but had been flummoxed by a screw for which they didn't have the right driver. I tried it with the owner and found it was working including on DAB. The issue was that the DAB reception was very poor where were and I suspect in the owners flat (many tall concrete building likely blocking signals and creating lots of signal reflections and crosspaths). So the radio was showing Unavailable and this was wrongly interpreted as the radio malfunctioning rather than the DAB signal being unavailable. We did manage to listen to a few DAB stations. I also suspect that reception may be better/worse depending on the multiplex on which a station belongs to."

Just confirm the voltage is correct and that the current rating is equal to (or exceeds) the failed adaptor. If the connector is wrong either fit the correct connector of cut and splice the old connector onto the new power adaptor. Before connecting to the radio use a multimeter to finally recheck voltage is correct and the positive and negative connections are the right way round.Roger."

The kettle had a light between the handle and switch that would glow through a small plastic window into the water while powered on.

This solved the problem, while altering a faulty feature of the kettle to make it safer - the glow was now in the handle, but not corroding.

The belt supplied was not an appropriate fit for the machine - what websites were supplying was a 61cm timing belt with trapezoidal grooves perpendicular to the belt, as used on cars and printers, while the motor drive pulley on this machine had grooves parallel to the belt, more similar to those on washing machines, and this belt was extremely tight to fit given the plastic driven pulley.One repairer still managed to make it fit, but in doing so removed a screw that was supposed to be locking the pulley onto a flat on the drive shaft. In actuality, the pulley was seized onto the shaft, and we weren't able to remove it to make fitting the belt easier, so the user has been advised to bring it back if ever the pulley slips and the stirrer stops turning again, but the machine turned fine with the new belt so we don't expect an issue any time soon."

By methodically disconnecting and testing for leakage, the problem was isolated to the heating element, which was found to be corroding.
