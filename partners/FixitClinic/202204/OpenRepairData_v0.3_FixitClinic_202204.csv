Hard drive and OS had no problem before  submitting laptop to Central Computer in Santa Clara for warranty repair, and now they allege there is a problem.  Historically this laptop had a manufacturing defect that Apple refused to repair under warranty.  The laptop was purchased in February 2012, even though it is considered late 2011 with a 2010 mfg date.  Supposedly the GPU failed due to a defect in the lead free solder.  I submitted it to Central Computer for repair without knowing that they don't do their own work and contract it out.  They have worked on it three different times, and no one really knows what they did on the first repair.  The laptop failed after 60 days, and failed three weeks later after the 2nd repair.  I am about to pickup the laptop after the 3rd repair, but apparently Central Computer now alleges something is wrong with the hard drive.  The hard drive was tested and in good working order after the 2nd repair, so I am a bit suspicious.  . Don't buy Apple.  They don't stand behind their products.  Historically there was a class action suit over my computer, but those filing the suit cancelled the litigation after Apple started repairing the computer.  The problem is that Apple supplied the complaints with more defective motherboards, and failed to notify other customers with the same issue that there was a defect. "

fixitclinic_722,"Fixit Clinic",USA,"electric waffle iron","Small kitchen item",29,"Dominion Electrical Mfg, Mansfield, OH",,,Repairable,,,2018-03-26,"The waffle iron (my mother's, dating to the 1940s) was disassembled and tested.  Preliminarily, since no substitute  cords were available, we reinserted the old line into the machine connector.  I had already intended to purchase a new cord.  The specific electrical requirements of the machine were explained to me, so now I know how to buy the correct cord.We unscrewed the bottom plate, exposing the workings of the lower griddle.  When tested, the electrical circuit was fine.  The control governing the degree of doneness of the waffle is a completely mechanical thing, running from the knob outside to two little flanges in the middle of the machine which expand or contract with heat.  They seemed to be a little stuck (which may account for complaints about overheating).  I was advised to sand them down with 600-1200 grit sandpaper to clear the accumulation.  I had a lot of questions about cleaning, water, etc. which were answered.  So far so good.When we unscrewed the top to expose the upper waffle iron, however, the electrical circuit did not complete.  The little white wires leading from the plug to the hot plate part were defective.  Diagnosis:  the white wires of both top and bottom valves need to be replaced, along with their receptor nuts and bolts; and the heat gauge flanges need to be sanded.  It should take an electrical repairman about an hour to do.  The going rate for electrical repair in Berkeley is $50-75/ hour.   As instructed, I will phone Al Lasher's Electronics on University Avenue for a recommendation.       . I am most grateful to Fix-It and the volunteers for your generous efforts to dig us out of the loathsome waste culture into which we have fallen.  I look forward to Fix-It 2.0, in which trivial repairs like mine can be addressed. . "

Came to the Fixit-clinic to see if the switch worked and get help putting the drill back together. This was harder than it looked,  but eventually all the  screws were in and  the switch was working. This is a very old drill that was in my family for a generation (or 2). It is as good or better than the DeWalt drills being  manufactured today so I was very happy that this drill was fixed. It is a MUCH better drill than the Makita drill that my husband owns. Always a good idea to have a core collection of your own tools. I LOVE the Fixit-clinics.

I suspected it was simply a fuse that had blown.  Once the appliance was opened, using testing-meters, it was determined that the thermal fuse had blown.  During the time of the clinic, I was able to pick up a new thermal fuse from Al Lescher's in Berkeley. When I returned to the Clinic the old fuse was replaced with a new one ($1.60) and the hot roller appliance was back in working order. Visiting the Fix-it Clinic was such a fascinating & curious experience.  I could not get over the sincere effort on the part of the team-members to seriously address the issues related to each  person's concern.  The collaboration and sharing of ideas and tools was awesome. "

It was lengthened a fair amount by not having the appropriate solution to clean and prep the bare lcd screen as well. "
