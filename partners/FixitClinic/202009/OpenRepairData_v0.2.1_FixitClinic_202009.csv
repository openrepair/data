Hard drive and OS had no problem before  submitting laptop to Central Computer in Santa Clara for warranty repair, and now they allege there is a problem.  Historically this laptop had a manufacturing defect that Apple refused to repair under warranty.  The laptop was purchased in February 2012, even though it is considered late 2011 with a 2010 mfg date.  Supposedly the GPU failed due to a defect in the lead free solder.  I submitted it to Central Computer for repair without knowing that they don't do their own work and contract it out.  They have worked on it three different times, and no one really knows what they did on the first repair.  The laptop failed after 60 days, and failed three weeks later after the 2nd repair.  I am about to pickup the laptop after the 3rd repair, but apparently Central Computer now alleges something is wrong with the hard drive.  The hard drive was tested and in good working order after the 2nd repair, so I am a bit suspicious.  "
