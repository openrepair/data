fixitclinic_3,"Fixit Clinic",USA,"Artificial christmas tree lights","Decorative or safety lights",3,GE,,,Unknown,,"Fixit Clinic",2018-01-13,"The team spent about 2 hours trying to get some of the strings to work. We got some lights to work. It seemed that some of the wiring was faulty. In the end, we decided it made sense to remove the lights and replace with new strings. This solution was far superior to purchasing a new tree. The challenge was that the GE lights had ""current limiting"" sockets that did not take regular bulbs. We went down the path of following these instructions:http://www.gatwood.net/odds_and_ends/ge_lights.htmlYou can try this, but you might just want to remove the old strings and hang new ones. I thought that the new strings would not look as neat as the ready-made ones, but the Fixit helper informed me that I could wrap the new string around the tree in the same way that the old ones had been placed."

Historically this laptop had a manufacturing defect that Apple refused to repair under warranty. The laptop was purchased in February 2012, even though it is considered late 2011 with a 2010 mfg date. Supposedly the GPU failed due to a defect in the lead free solder. I submitted it to Central Computer for repair without knowing that they don't do their own work and contract it out. They have worked on it three different times, and no one really knows what they did on the first repair. The laptop failed after 60 days, and failed three weeks later after the 2nd repair. I am about to pickup the laptop after the 3rd repair, but apparently Central Computer now alleges something is wrong with the hard drive.

fixitclinic_722,"Fixit Clinic",USA,"electric waffle iron","Small kitchen item",29,"Dominion Electrical Mfg, Mansfield, OH",,,Repairable,,"Fixit Clinic",2018-03-26,"The waffle iron (my mother's, dating to the 1940s) was disassembled and tested. Preliminarily, since no substitute cords were available, we reinserted the old line into the machine connector. I had already intended to purchase a new cord. The specific electrical requirements of the machine were explained to me, so now I know how to buy the correct cord.We unscrewed the bottom plate, exposing the workings of the lower griddle. When tested, the electrical circuit was fine. The control governing the degree of doneness of the waffle is a completely mechanical thing, running from the knob outside to two little flanges in the middle of the machine which expand or contract with heat. They seemed to be a little stuck (which may account for complaints about overheating). I was advised to sand them down with 600-1200 grit sandpaper to clear the accumulation. I had a lot of questions about cleaning, water, etc. which were answered. So far so good.When we unscrewed the top to expose the upper waffle iron, however, the electrical circuit did not complete. The little white wires leading from the plug to the hot plate part were defective. Diagnosis: the white wires of both top and bottom valves need to be replaced, along with their receptor nuts and bolts; and the heat gauge flanges need to be sanded. It should take an electrical repairman about an hour to do. The going rate for electrical repair in Berkeley is $50-75/ hour. As instructed, I will phone Al Lasher's Electronics on University Avenue for a recommendation. The decision to restore a vintage electrical appliance is based on many factors. The initial assessment at the clinic establishes an upper limit of feasibility and cost. Beyond that, more personal considerations-- environmental, aesthetic and sentimental-- must be taken into account. How much do I loathe sending things to landfill (or having them sent to landfill by whoever inherits the non functional waffle iron)? A lot. Would a second-hand replacement (say from the Oakland Museum White Elephant Sale) be any safe"

First we checked the cord connections to the bulb socket and re-connected them to make sure they were tight and clean. The multimeter indicated that there was still a problem, though, so we took the lamp apart and found that the entire wire needed replacing. We did this, ensuring that the ground wire and the live wire were consistently threaded throughout. We left happily with a working lamp. First, make sure you have the right tools: screwdriver, wire strippers/cutters, a replacement wire that is the right length and meant to carry the same voltage, and a multimeter, at bare minimum. Our lamp was a floor lamp with a tall, skinny post that the cable went through. I wished I'd had a long, narrow stick that I could poke into that post. Next, take a good look at your lamp and think about how it might come apart. Look for screws, caps, or other joined places that will provide access to the wire inside the lamp. Think about what might be necessary in order to get the wire out (and in). Visualizing the process before you start is a good idea. There's probably a lot of reference on how to go about fixing the wiring on a lamp online, but it was very helpful to have someone guide us through the process. I never would have thought to use a multimeter, but using it as a way of testing our work instead of just plugging the lamp in was a good thing, it avoided potentially shorting the circuit at the event."

My volunteer repair guy and I decided that it was probably not vital and he gave me some angled tweezers and a pair of tiny diagonal cutting pliers to cut it out. I used it once this last week and it seems to be working fine. We think that it was a motor cooling fan and my only concern going forward is that the driver will overheat with hard use.

When I returned to the Clinic the old fuse was replaced with a new one ($1.60) and the hot roller appliance was back in working order. The ""fix"" was quite simple after the diagnosis.

The job was complicated due to the age of the tape deck and lack of a service manual but worth doing because of the quality of the machine. Thanks to their efforts, the tape deck is now working again. I appreciate the fact that the idea behind Fixit Clinics is to involve participants in repairing their items and to teach people how to carry out repairs. However, I think allowances need to be made for the complexity of the item involved, the age of the item, the experience (or lack thereof) of the owner, and the experience of fixers with older models. I would advise attendees to go to Fixit Clinics with hopes of getting their items repaired but feel that they should not have unrealistic expectations.

fixitclinic_770,"Fixit Clinic",USA,ipad,Tablet,30,Apple,,,Repairable,,"Fixit Clinic",2019-04-23,"With the generous help of Rob, Brian, and Mike, we eventually removed the cracked screen with a heat gun, and removed and replaced the home button and digitizer attachments that came with my new screen. The removal of the cracked screen took so long that by the time the new screen was on, I decided to pack it up and plug it in another time to attempt to turn it on before securing the adhesive of the new screen. (We were able to see that it responded to charging, pushing the home button, and pushing the power button, so I'm pretty confident it will turn on). The time it took was lengthened by not having gloves or a headlamp, and not having a way immediately on hand, of cleaning the adhesive from the tweezers in order to deal with the tiny screws blocking access to the digitizer attachments. It was lengthened a fair amount by not having the appropriate solution to clean and prep the bare lcd screen as well. I recommend setting aside a good hour and a half for the removal of the old screen and pieces related to it, depending on how cracked the screen is (mine was very thoroughly cracked). I was very glad I'd bought a new screen that came with a kit. The tools in the kit were absolutely necessary, and I could have done with even more guitar picks. The kit was TechOrbits ASIN B0160ERA7U off Amazon. I wish I had researched beforehand what solution Apple uses to clean their bare LCD screens. Iso was not a good choice, and the microfiber cloths were not overly effective due to the foam gasket. I wish I had brought gloves and a headlamp, as well as a cup for screws (thanks Brian!), a container for glass shards, packing tape (thanks Brian!), small pliars (thanks Mike!), canned air (thanks Susan!) and paper towels."

We replaced the motor and now the turntable turns. Yay! Changing the motor was easy, but getting the case/housing off the microwave was challenging. On the bottom of the microwave, there was a covering right over the motor, but we didn't think we could open it since it required cutting metal to do so.To get the case off, we needed a special tool (Security Torx screwdriver, which is a 6-sided star-shaped screwdriver with a pin in it) and luckily (amazingly), someone at the Fixit Clinic had one. We also used a regular Phillips screwdriver. We kept liberating parts of the case and finding that we had to unscrew more screws to get to the area we needed.(Also, it's a bit intimidating working with electric wires and stuff but we just avoided touching those.) After a lot of work, we got the whole case off of the microwave, but none of that was necessary after all. EXCEPT, by opening the case, we found some super secret instructions taped onto the microwave underneath the case, so it DID tell us what to do! It turned out we COULD get in through the covering right over the motor (so we only needed to open that, not take the entire case off). It turned out, you do just cut the metal, open it up, replace the motor, and then rotate the cover 180 degrees and it has tabs that slip into slots so it can be reused after being cut. The motor itself just needed to be unplugged, rotated, and pulled out. Then we plugged in the new one and rotated it into place. Voila!"

Also, as suggested, I saved the silver switch housing from the old lamp, so that I could reuse it (instead of the brass color that came with the replacement part). As a result, it looks just like it always did. When buying the switch, make sure you know what your wattage is and whether or not you need a 3-way or regular switch.

Before the fixit clinic, the only thing I could possibly test was whether the thermostat was still working by trying to click it on. But considering that it didn’t seem to power on at all, that test wasn’t very conclusive. Our problem ended up being electrical; the overload protector was broken. We had a multimeter on hand and with our fixit helpers, we stepped through testing every component via a helpful schematic provided on the back of the fridge and concluded it must be the overload protector. We tested this by removing the part and directly connecting the power to the compressor. It turned on and started humming! Thankfully the problem wasn’t the compressor and the new part was only $8 to try. My recommendation would be to have a multimeter on hand to test the electrical components. YouTube mentioned that most problems with mini fridges tended to be electrical and we were happy to find that it was.

The final gear sits in a sleeve that has another gear on it and it was spinning within that sleeve but shouldn't have been. Putting a bit of epoxy on it fixed it! Of course in the process of fixing it I broke one of the soldered points off so I had to purchase a soldering iron and re-attach it. But now it's working perfectly!Up until this event I just thought it was the motor slowing down but someone pointed out that because it's an AC motor it's driven by the current and if the motor is going, it's going at the correct speed. I had been putting WD-40 in but that wasn't helping. Knowing that this AC motor was an on/off type of thing, i.e., they can't slow down, they work or they don't, meant that we knew it was in the gears which isolated the problem."

At repair event the probable issue was determined to be a series of switches that are engaged by the door. Went ahead and ordered a latch hook, PHOK-A137WRFZ, two switches QSW-MA131WRE0 and a switch/fuse combination FFS-BA021WRK0. I removed the latch hook assembly and tested the three switches. They seemed fine. Installed the new latch hook with the new switches, but noticed that this assembly is designed to be adjustable and has ""play"" while the two screws that hold it aren't tightened. With the door closed, this assembly can be accurately aligned to optimally engage the switches. I did this and then tightened the two screws holding it with the hope they would not move over many years. The system works now without any intermittent failures. When the oven was in a state where it wouldn't start, it could reliably be started after going through one or more cycles of pushing the ""open"" mechanical button on the front while holding the door closed. This process is referred to in the service manual as helpful in aligning the latch hook. It also exercises the process of engaging the 3 switches on the latch hook and might guide people to this resolution."

They commented that it was not meant to be repaired, which is why it was so difficult. Next they checked the electrical connections with a probe. Lastly, they bent some of the plastic pieces. That solved the problem so it stayed down and then popped up. If you don't have the equipment mentioned, come to a Fixit Clinic. First, unscrew the bottom. If there are no screws, look for the only thing that can be what is holding the bottom of the toaster on. Using a pair of pliers, turn the metal parts sticking up 90 degrees. It took me several tries to get a good grip. If you have a tool that detects a circuit, then put one probe on a ground (I think) and the other end on the connections in the thing that makes the toaster pop up. Test each connection succesively (there were several in my toaster). If the connections are sound. then look at the plastic pieces and try to determine where they are preventing the toaster from staying down. Very carefully, bend them, but not so far that they break. Good luck."
