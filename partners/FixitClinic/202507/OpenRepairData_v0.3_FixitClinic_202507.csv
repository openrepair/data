The team spent about 2 hours trying to get some of the strings to work. We got some lights to work. It seemed that some of the wiring was faulty. In the end, we decided it made sense to remove the lights and replace with new strings. This solution was far superior to purchasing a new tree. The challenge was that the GE lights had ""current limiting"" sockets that did not take regular bulbs. We went down the path of following these instructions: http://www.gatwood.net/odds_and_ends/ge_lights.html You can try this, but you might just want to remove the old strings and hang new ones. I thought that the new strings would not look as neat as the ready-made ones, but the Fixit helper informed me that I could wrap the new string around the tree in the same way that the old ones had been placed."

What didn't work he was hoping we didn't have to dismantle the base and just clean the well where the top unit (with liquids) would sit, but it was better to open the whole thing and clean it I learned that there is a great way to thread screw on items by backing them up first until you hear a click, I learned that there is such a thing as plastic dissolving lubricants (WD40) and to use graphite instead. Know where the switches are and how they work in the base, and keep clean."

fixitclinic_2126,Fixit Clinic,USA,water kettle,Kettle,14,Precise Heat,"","",Unknown,"",Fixit Clinic,2024-01-24,". Attempted to open up the base of the kettle (did not succeed due to specialized screw head). Gently straightening out the contact points between kettle and base; while I was happy that neither broke due to this, it didn't make any difference. Using sandpaper to clean the contact point between kettle and base; also didn't make any difference.. Tested by rotating kettle around base to find weak contact points (dead spots) to learn that the contact points were worn where the kettle has been most commonly positioned while in use; this confirmed that I should keep employing my current workaround of rotating and adjusting the kettle slightly on the base when it doesn't turn on. Try cleaning contact points first. If there is a specialized screwhead that you've never seen, then that probably means the manufacturer doesn't want you to open it up. Do a basic google search before going to the repair clinic. Try the Fixit clinic more as a learning opportunity and to satisfy curiosity, without necessarily expecting your item to be fixed."

fixitclinic_2290,Fixit Clinic,USA,"table fan, single-speed non oscillating",Fan,7,Galaxy,"","",Fixed,"",Fixit Clinic,2025-01-27,"Initial issue: intermittently not working and would hum but blades would barely turn or not at all. At the repair event, we took it apart starting with the plastic clips holding the outer ""cage"". We noticed it was dusty, the main rod attaching to the blades was rusted, and the blades turned but were stiff. I had oiled it at home but not taken it apart. We continued disassembly, next removing the fan blades. They took a firm and steady pull to get off the main pole. Be careful here, because the plastic can crack around where it threads onto the pole. Mine did and we had to glue it. Next, we removed the 2 nuts and washers holding the back of the ""cage"" onto the fan. From there, the next disassembly was to get the motor out. I wanted to check the electronics and see if anything looked bad. We removed the bolts holding the legs/base and that allowed the motor to slide out. We had to flex the plastic to get it out. there are also 2 metal tabs that the bolts screw into, acting as nuts. make sure not to lose those. Once we pulled out the motor, someone came over to help who was familiar w similar fans. He suggested we lubricate the bearings both at the front and back of the rotating pole. Everything just looked old and rusty, but nothing was super messed up. We used deoxit to lube the parts, and it made a huge difference. We also krazy glued the part of the fan blade assembly that we'd inadvertently broken during disassembly. Lastly, we scraped off some of the rust from the main pole near where the blades attach. When reassembling, make sure the base is pointing in the right direction. Make sure you screw the base bolts into the metal tabs. when reattaching the fan blades, make sure the plastic gaps line up with the little perpendicular metal stoppers that stick out from the pole. After reassembling some, we tested and saw that the fan ran quietly and well. After full reassembly, the same was true. lubing the back bearing was important for long term repair!

The volunteer showed me how to take the cover off, taking care to watch for the springs that held the brushes (and the orientation of the brushes). After we removed the cover we could see there was a lot of flour dust everywhere so we brushed off what we could with a wire brush and used a air canister to blow out more. Then the volunteer squirted some DeoxIT electrical cleaner/lubricant on a few spots. He showed me the spark that is generated when the motor is on-- probably what I was smelling. The mixer seems to be functioning and the cleaning/lubricating should help it. The volunteer showed me how the motor worked on the mixer- very interesting! (see above)"

Before the event I had taken the driver apart and seen that there was a plastic ring that had come loose from the motor and was responsible for the disturbing sounds the driver was making when used. My volunteer repair guy and I decided that it was probably not vital and he gave me some angled tweezers and a pair of tiny diagonal cutting pliers to cut it out. I used it once this last week and it seems to be working fine. We think that it was a motor cooling fan and my only concern going forward is that the driver will overheat with hard use. You need a T9 security hex wrench to get the body of the driver apart.

When we arrived, a Volunteer (Tom) showed us how to use a multimeter in order to determine that yes, our lamp had a short. First we checked the cord connections to the bulb socket and re-connected them to make sure they were tight and clean. The multimeter indicated that there was still a problem, though, so we took the lamp apart and found that the entire wire needed replacing. We did this, ensuring that the ground wire and the live wire were consistently threaded throughout. We left happily with a working lamp. First, make sure you have the right tools: screwdriver, wire strippers/cutters, a replacement wire that is the right length and meant to carry the same voltage, and a multimeter, at bare minimum. Our lamp was a floor lamp with a tall, skinny post that the cable went through. I wished I'd had a long, narrow stick that I could poke into that post. Next, take a good look at your lamp and think about how it might come apart. Look for screws, caps, or other joined places that will provide access to the wire inside the lamp. Think about what might be necessary in order to get the wire out (and in). Visualizing the process before you start is a good idea. There's probably a lot of reference on how to go about fixing the wiring on a lamp online, but it was very helpful to have someone guide us through the process. I never would have thought to use a multimeter, but using it as a way of testing our work instead of just plugging the lamp in was a good thing, it avoided potentially shorting the circuit at the event."

Of course in the process of fixing it I broke one of the soldered points off so I had to purchase a soldering iron and re-attach it. But now it's working perfectly! Up until this event I just thought it was the motor slowing down but someone pointed out that because it's an AC motor it's driven by the current and if the motor is going, it's going at the correct speed. I had been putting WD-40 in but that wasn't helping. Knowing that this AC motor was an on/off type of thing, i.e., they can't slow down, they work or they don't, meant that we knew it was in the gears which isolated the problem."

fixitclinic_1711,Fixit Clinic,USA,microwave,Large home electrical,17,GE,"","",Fixed,"",Fixit Clinic,2020-02-10,". The microwave turntable wasn't turning, so I had purchased a replacement motor over a year ago and brought it with me to the event. We replaced the motor and now the turntable turns. Yay! Changing the motor was easy, but getting the case/housing off the microwave was challenging. On the bottom of the microwave, there was a covering right over the motor, but we didn't think we could open it since it required cutting metal to do so. To get the case off, we needed a special tool (Security Torx screwdriver, which is a 6-sided star-shaped screwdriver with a pin in it) and luckily (amazingly), someone at the Fixit Clinic had one. We also used a regular Phillips screwdriver. We kept liberating parts of the case and finding that we had to unscrew more screws to get to the area we needed. (Also, it's a bit intimidating working with electric wires and stuff but we just avoided touching those.) After a lot of work, we got the whole case off of the microwave, but none of that was necessary after all. EXCEPT, by opening the case, we found some super secret instructions taped onto the microwave underneath the case, so it DID tell us what to do! It turned out we COULD get in through the covering right over the motor (so we only needed to open that, not take the entire case off). It turned out, you do just cut the metal, open it up, replace the motor, and then rotate the cover 180 degrees and it has tabs that slip into slots so it can be reused after being cut. The motor itself just needed to be unplugged, rotated, and pulled out. Then we plugged in the new one and rotated it into place. Voila! ."

The issue with the coffee maker was that the water did not pump. The grinder function and the display still worked, but no water flowed through the system. We took the coffee maker apart to look for the pump. After taking it all the way apart, we realized that there was no pump and the coffee maker used heat alone to push water through the tubing. The issue was that a thermal fuse had blown, and so the circuit for the heating element was broken. A fixer helped me test the connectivity of the fuse and soldered a new wire to bypass the broken fuse (the coffee maker had a second, redundant thermal fuse that had not blown). After this repair step, the coffee maker worked! I have made my coffee with it every morning since. Check the connectivity of the various electrical components first. This was something we could have done very early in the process, and if we had then we would have avoided the cumbersome process of taking the coffee maker apart."

It was great that there was a hardware store across the street. I was able to quickly purchase a new part, bring it back and get it installed by attaching the two wires coming out of the cord to either side of the new switch part and insert the whole switch part into the base. Then it was just a matter of making sure everything was tight, screwing the lightbulb back in and testing it...and then there was light! Thanks, FixIt Clinic!"

fixitclinic_1797,Fixit Clinic,USA,Washing Machine,Large home electrical,17,Samsung,"","",Fixed,"",Fixit Clinic,2021-02-05,". The problem in my case was the door lock. I blame the implementation of child safety for the problem: if child safety is engaged, kids are still able to turn ON/OFF the appliance. Also if the appliance is ON the same protection engages the lock that is disengaged when OFF. This means that despite child safety a kid can still lock and unlock the door by repetedly clicking the power button. In my case this stress eventually broke the lock, which had to be replaced. Replacing the lock is relatively easy and requires a screwdriver and a pair of pliers. Follow this video https://youtu.be/C2k3w6suShU?t=196 to see how to remove the silicone seal. Once the seal is removed, you unscrew the lock with the 2 screws on the front so you can replace it."

It took a long time to figure out how to do so, but two fixers were able to partially dismantle the tape deck, remove the UK transmission, and put the original transmission back into the tape deck. Their comment was ""They don't make them like they used to."" The job was complicated due to the age of the tape deck and lack of a service manual but worth doing because of the quality of the machine. Thanks to their efforts, the tape deck is now working again. I appreciate the fact that the idea behind Fixit Clinics is to involve participants in repairing their items and to teach people how to carry out repairs. However, I think allowances need to be made for the complexity of the item involved, the age of the item, the experience (or lack thereof) of the owner, and the experience of fixers with older models. I would advise attendees to go to Fixit Clinics with hopes of getting their items repaired but feel that they should not have unrealistic expectations.

fixitclinic_1286,Fixit Clinic,USA,electric waffle iron,Small kitchen item,29,"Dominion Electrical Mfg, Mansfield, OH","","",Repairable,"",Fixit Clinic,2018-03-26,". The waffle iron (my mother's, dating to the 1940s) was disassembled and tested. Preliminarily, since no substitute cords were available, we reinserted the old line into the machine connector. I had already intended to purchase a new cord. The specific electrical requirements of the machine were explained to me, so now I know how to buy the correct cord. We unscrewed the bottom plate, exposing the workings of the lower griddle. When tested, the electrical circuit was fine. The control governing the degree of doneness of the waffle is a completely mechanical thing, running from the knob outside to two little flanges in the middle of the machine which expand or contract with heat. They seemed to be a little stuck (which may account for complaints about overheating). I was advised to sand them down with 600-1200 grit sandpaper to clear the accumulation. I had a lot of questions about cleaning, water, etc. which were answered. So far so good. When we unscrewed the top to expose the upper waffle iron, however, the electrical circuit did not complete. The little white wires leading from the plug to the hot plate part were defective. Diagnosis: the white wires of both top and bottom valves need to be replaced, along with their receptor nuts and bolts; and the heat gauge flanges need to be sanded. It should take an electrical repairman about an hour to do. The going rate for electrical repair in Berkeley is $50-75/ hour. As instructed, I will phone Al Lasher's Electronics on University Avenue for a recommendation. The decision to restore a vintage electrical appliance is based on many factors. The initial assessment at the clinic establishes an upper limit of feasibility and cost. Beyond that, more personal considerations-- environmental, aesthetic and sentimental-- must be taken into account. How much do I loathe sending things to landfill (or having them sent to landfill by whoever inherits the non functional waffle iron)? A lot. Would a second-hand replacement (say from the Oakland Museum White Elephant Sale) be any safer than an appliance (ungrounded, to be sure) which I had had rewired? No. Do I even need a waffle iron? I've lived thirty years with this one in storage. But so many interesting new whole grain waffle recipes are circulating. Could I find a second-hand stove-top iron? As I see it right now, this is a perfectly good waffle iron which can be fixed with a trivial amount of work. Since I lack the skills to fix it myself I have to pay someone to do it. For people retired on a small fixed income in Berkeley everything is ridiculously expensive. I have suggested several times to the North Berkeley Senior Center that it would be good to maintain a list of retired repairmen who would be willing to undertake occasional work for less than the going rate. I have even suggested a program of exchanged work or skills. I can cook or garden expertly in exchange for a small electrical repair. In vain. The unimaginative management is totally uninterested in improving the lives of its members."

I got the lamp to the fixit clinic, and it was fixed …took almost hour but 2 of the fixers put their heads together, one tested the circuits, and one supplied a new switch, which they had also tested and determined the lamp needed replaced. It was tricky due to the placement of the switch inside the middle of one of the 4 tubes making up the lamp stand. But after a lot of fiddling, they got it inside and working. And then I got the entire lamp home, and since it was fully assembled now, that wasnt easy. When i finally put a light bulb in and turned on the lamp at home (it had been checked multiple times during the repair process somI knew it should work unless I had messed up the wiring moving it from my car to upstairs) and it DIDNT TURN ON! I just had to shrug and say to myself, well, all it took was a couple hours of my time to try…too bad. Then i had the bright idea of making sure the light bulb worked - put a different bulb in, and voila! WORKING! I am SO grateful - and glad all that work by the two ‘fixers’ and my own time wasn’t wasred! This lamp was very hard to fix due to it’s poor design. Takes a lot of patience and know-how.

With the generous help of Rob, Brian, and Mike, we eventually removed the cracked screen with a heat gun, and removed and replaced the home button and digitizer attachments that came with my new screen. The removal of the cracked screen took so long that by the time the new screen was on, I decided to pack it up and plug it in another time to attempt to turn it on before securing the adhesive of the new screen. (We were able to see that it responded to charging, pushing the home button, and pushing the power button, so I'm pretty confident it will turn on). The time it took was lengthened by not having gloves or a headlamp, and not having a way immediately on hand, of cleaning the adhesive from the tweezers in order to deal with the tiny screws blocking access to the digitizer attachments. It was lengthened a fair amount by not having the appropriate solution to clean and prep the bare lcd screen as well. I recommend setting aside a good hour and a half for the removal of the old screen and pieces related to it, depending on how cracked the screen is (mine was very thoroughly cracked). I was very glad I'd bought a new screen that came with a kit. The tools in the kit were absolutely necessary, and I could have done with even more guitar picks. The kit was TechOrbits ASIN B0160ERA7U off Amazon. I wish I had researched beforehand what solution Apple uses to clean their bare LCD screens. Iso was not a good choice, and the microfiber cloths were not overly effective due to the foam gasket. I wish I had brought gloves and a headlamp, as well as a cup for screws (thanks Brian!), a container for glass shards, packing tape (thanks Brian!), small pliars (thanks Mike!), canned air (thanks Susan!) and paper towels."

I would strongly encourage them to attend one of these events to learn to troubleshoot, weed out various options, and finally fix the problem. Fred did a great job, and the younger man with the soldering iron saved me at least $100 and wasted time and energy shipping this 30 year old, no longer made, appliance.

At repair event the probable issue was determined to be a series of switches that are engaged by the door. Went ahead and ordered a latch hook, PHOK-A137WRFZ, two switches QSW-MA131WRE0 and a switch/fuse combination FFS-BA021WRK0. I removed the latch hook assembly and tested the three switches. They seemed fine. Installed the new latch hook with the new switches, but noticed that this assembly is designed to be adjustable and has ""play"" while the two screws that hold it aren't tightened. With the door closed, this assembly can be accurately aligned to optimally engage the switches. I did this and then tightened the two screws holding it with the hope they would not move over many years. The system works now without any intermittent failures. When the oven was in a state where it wouldn't start, it could reliably be started after going through one or more cycles of pushing the ""open"" mechanical button on the front while holding the door closed. This process is referred to in the service manual as helpful in aligning the latch hook. It also exercises the process of engaging the 3 switches on the latch hook and might guide people to this resolution."

They commented that it was not meant to be repaired, which is why it was so difficult. Next they checked the electrical connections with a probe. Lastly, they bent some of the plastic pieces. That solved the problem so it stayed down and then popped up. If you don't have the equipment mentioned, come to a Fixit Clinic. First, unscrew the bottom. If there are no screws, look for the only thing that can be what is holding the bottom of the toaster on. Using a pair of pliers, turn the metal parts sticking up 90 degrees. It took me several tries to get a good grip. If you have a tool that detects a circuit, then put one probe on a ground (I think) and the other end on the connections in the thing that makes the toaster pop up. Test each connection succesively (there were several in my toaster). If the connections are sound. then look at the plastic pieces and try to determine where they are preventing the toaster from staying down. Very carefully, bend them, but not so far that they break.

Since the lamp clearly wasn't working especially when I wiggled the switch around, as suggested by the people in the fixit clinic, I went to a hardware store (Lowe's) to buy a new switch mechanism for the lamp. Specifically, I bought the ""Lamp Socket"" by Hillman, part number 427694, that works with 3-way lamps. It was easy to take the old mechanism and replace with the new one. Also, as suggested, I saved the silver switch housing from the old lamp, so that I could reuse it (instead of the brass color that came with the replacement part). As a result, it looks just like it always did. When buying the switch, make sure you know what your wattage is and whether or not you need a 3-way or regular switch.

But I can say I found the whole board here if someone can get in touch with them (I failed): http://www.point-tech.cn/shouchijiaobanjikongzhiban/36-36.html I have gone further with it to a open circle with someone who repairs as profession - and he figured out what component that was failing - but sadly enough there was no number or mark on that part, so it was hard to order and replace. I think similar items hopefully got other problems, but this seems very hard to fix. I havent given up totally yet. Will involve some electronic forums for the component - but this was def not a small simple fix."

Before the fixit clinic, the only thing I could possibly test was whether the thermostat was still working by trying to click it on. But considering that it didn’t seem to power on at all, that test wasn’t very conclusive. Our problem ended up being electrical; the overload protector was broken. We had a multimeter on hand and with our fixit helpers, we stepped through testing every component via a helpful schematic provided on the back of the fridge and concluded it must be the overload protector. We tested this by removing the part and directly connecting the power to the compressor. It turned on and started humming! Thankfully the problem wasn’t the compressor and the new part was only $8 to try. My recommendation would be to have a multimeter on hand to test the electrical components. YouTube mentioned that most problems with mini fridges tended to be electrical and we were happy to find that it was. I was concerned that the compressor was broken, which would likely be a much more expensive and involved repair."

Non-working lamp was stored in the garage for several years with the hope that it would eventually reach the top of my ""to fix"" list. At the last repair event in August 2021 at Circuit Launch Makerspace in Oakland, CA, I brought the lamp. To my utter surprise, I turned the lamp on, and it worked! I could only venture a guess as to what happened. My first thoughts were that there was an electrical problem of some kind...Was it the cord, the switch, the bulb or some other part? Since I had done nothing to the lamp but store it in the garage, with flourscent bulb and all, now I'm thinking that maybe some oily gunk got clogged somewhere and the 100+ degrees that had occurred in recent months in my garage melted the gunk, and now things are working???"
