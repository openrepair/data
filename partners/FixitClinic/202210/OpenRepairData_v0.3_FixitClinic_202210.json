Hard drive and OS had no problem before  submitting laptop to Central Computer in Santa Clara for warranty repair, and now they allege there is a problem.  Historically this laptop had a manufacturing defect that Apple refused to repair under warranty.  The laptop was purchased in February 2012, even though it is considered late 2011 with a 2010 mfg date.  Supposedly the GPU failed due to a defect in the lead free solder.  I submitted it to Central Computer for repair without knowing that they don't do their own work and contract it out.  They have worked on it three different times, and no one really knows what they did on the first repair.  The laptop failed after 60 days, and failed three weeks later after the 2nd repair.  I am about to pickup the laptop after the 3rd repair, but apparently Central Computer now alleges something is wrong with the hard drive.  The hard drive was tested and in good working order after the 2nd repair, so I am a bit suspicious.  . Don't buy Apple.  They don't stand behind their products.  Historically there was a class action suit over my computer, but those filing the suit cancelled the litigation after Apple started repairing the computer.  The problem is that Apple supplied the complaints with more defective motherboards, and failed to notify other customers with the same issue that there was a defect. "

Preliminarily, since no substitute  cords were available, we reinserted the old line into the machine connector.  I had already intended to purchase a new cord.  The specific electrical requirements of the machine were explained to me, so now I know how to buy the correct cord.We unscrewed the bottom plate, exposing the workings of the lower griddle.  When tested, the electrical circuit was fine.  The control governing the degree of doneness of the waffle is a completely mechanical thing, running from the knob outside to two little flanges in the middle of the machine which expand or contract with heat.  They seemed to be a little stuck (which may account for complaints about overheating).  I was advised to sand them down with 600-1200 grit sandpaper to clear the accumulation.  I had a lot of questions about cleaning, water, etc. which were answered.  So far so good.When we unscrewed the top to expose the upper waffle iron, however, the electrical circuit did not complete.  The little white wires leading from the plug to the hot plate part were defective.  Diagnosis:  the white wires of both top and bottom valves need to be replaced, along with their receptor nuts and bolts; and the heat gauge flanges need to be sanded.  It should take an electrical repairman about an hour to do.  The going rate for electrical repair in Berkeley is $50-75\/ hour.   As instructed, I will phone Al Lasher's Electronics on University Avenue for a recommendation.       . I am most grateful to Fix-It and the volunteers for your generous efforts to dig us out of the loathsome waste culture into which we have fallen.  I look forward to Fix-It 2.0, in which trivial repairs like mine can be addressed. . "

Came to the Fixit-clinic to see if the switch worked and get help putting the drill back together. This was harder than it looked,  but eventually all the  screws were in and  the switch was working. This is a very old drill that was in my family for a generation (or 2). It is as good or better than the DeWalt drills being  manufactured today so I was very happy that this drill was fixed. It is a MUCH better drill than the Makita drill that my husband owns. Always a good idea to have a core collection of your own tools. I LOVE the Fixit-clinics. Please schedule more of them in  Berkeley. "

I assumed that I would need to replace the fan. I appreciate the knowledge of your fix-it coaches.  Coming to your clinics has made me more brave about taking things apart to fix on my own, but in this case I presumed I'd need to replace the fan, which would involve a lot more taking apart of the computer and buying a replacement.  It would not have occurred to me that there was a viable lubricant I could spray in there. . "

The removal of the cracked screen took so long that by the time the new screen was on, I decided to pack it up and plug it in another time to attempt to turn it on before securing the adhesive of the new screen. (We were able to see that it responded to charging, pushing the home button, and pushing the power button, so I'm pretty confident it will turn on). The time it took was lengthened by not having gloves or a headlamp, and not having a way immediately on hand, of cleaning the adhesive from the tweezers in order to deal with the tiny screws blocking access to the digitizer attachments. It was lengthened a fair amount by not having the appropriate solution to clean and prep the bare lcd screen as well. "

If that fails, I may hold on to toaster until another clinic. Or I may do otherwise. The fixers explained to me some of the things I didn't understand--like how a bimetallic strip bends when heated, showed me where the contacts were that started the current flow, and showed where the connections were. Why repair it: the toaster has a unique mechanism, was manufactured in 1953, and had worked until 2018. "

At first turning it off and in again once got it working, then  it had to be turned on and off  a few times, but still would start. Last week it quit entirely. I tried replacing the halogen bulb (which we\u2019ve  done numerous times since we purchased it more than ten years ago) but it still won\u2019t start. This lamps twin is still going strong\u2014 which makes it's demise all the more frustrating. "

The volunteer showed me how to take the cover off, taking care to watch for the springs that held the brushes (and the orientation of the brushes). After we removed the cover we could see there was a lot of flour dust everywhere so we brushed off what we could with a wire brush and used a air canister to blow out more. Then the volunteer squirted some DeoxIT electrical cleaner\/lubricant on a few spots. He showed me the spark that is generated when the motor is on-- probably what I was smelling. The mixer seems to be functioning and the cleaning\/lubricating should help it. The volunteer showed me how the motor worked on the mixer- very interesting!  . Thank you for having this event! I am reassured that my item is functional and not burning up its motor!. "

No one considered themselves an expert but was still willing to help us step through trying to identify the problem patiently.

Someone on the call was able to identify this path because the final gear, the one that turns the time dial, could be turned by hand and it shouldn't have been able to. The final gear sits in a sleeve that has another gear on it and it was spinning within that sleeve but shouldn't have been. Putting a bit of epoxy on it fixed it! Of course in the process of fixing it I broke one of the soldered points off so I had to purchase a soldering iron and re-attach it. But now it's working perfectly!Up until this event I just thought it was the motor slowing down but someone pointed out that because it's an AC motor it's driven by the current and if the motor is going, it's going at the correct speed. I had been putting WD-40 in but that wasn't helping. . "

I looked up the problem online, diagnosed as a hook timing malfunction, tried to fix using YouTube videos, but could not find my model and the editing was such that the steps involving disassembly and reassembly were left out---crucial with internal circuit boards in the way.  Tried reading through a download of the Repair Manual, but the wording was not clear.  I bought the necessary tools, tried taking it apart a couple of times on my own nd aligning the needle with where I thought I remembered where it should be, forgot whether to use the hook wheel or hand wheel and now, the needle won't even catch the thread. . I don't have a car, so bringing it to a repair shop is very hard. Also the cost is very high just for a look-see. I have many projects planned with this machine and have no intention to throw it away. "

They seemed fine. Installed the new latch hook with the new switches, but noticed that this assembly is designed to be adjustable and has \"play\" while the two screws that hold it aren't tightened. With the door closed, this assembly can be accurately aligned to optimally engage the switches. I did this and then tightened the two screws holding it with the hope they would not move over many years. The system works now without any intermittent failures. Needed a Torx T20H to remove two of the outside screws. This is mentioned in the service manual. "
