# BattCat: A quest for barriers to repair and next steps

## What is this?

The data in the battcat.csv file is the result of an online quest where volunteer participants looked at repair attempts on battery-powered devices recorded at community events. For more information about repair events and repair data, visit the [Open Repair Alliance](https://openrepair.org/open-data/) website.

The tableschema.json file describes the data structure, validation, licensing and source.

## Where did it come from?

[BattCat](https://restarters.net/battcat/status) was an online quest held in 2021 using data from ORA partners.

## What was BattCat all about?

The aim of these quests was to sort the records into buckets of “barriers to repair” and "next steps".

Community repair events are busy with volunteers concentrating their efforts on the people and the devices that turn up. The data that gets recorded by a fixer is their description of the situation at the time. Our participants would read this "problem" text and judge whether it fitted any of the "barriers to repair" (for End of life devices) or "next steps" (for Repairable devices) that were presented.
