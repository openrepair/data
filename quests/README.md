# QUESTS

Quests are forays into Open Repair Data organised by [The Restart Project](https://restarters.net/workbench) with volunteers from the repair community using datasets published by the [Open Repair Alliance](https://openrepair.org/)

Data is collected at community events and enriched via quests to become strong evidence for better products. With the help of data volunteers we can change the system.
