# DustUp: A quest for fault types

## What is this?

The data in the dustup.csv file is the result of an online quest where volunteer participants looked at vacuum cleaner repair attempts recorded at community events. For more information about repair events and repair data, visit the [Open Repair Alliance](https://openrepair.org/open-data/) website.

The tableschema.json file describes the data structure, validation, licensing and source.

## Where did it come from?

[DustUp](https://restarters.net/dustup/status) was an online quest held in 2022 using data from ORA partners.

## What was DustUp all about?

The aim of these quests was to sort the records into buckets of fault “types”.

Community repair events are busy with volunteers concentrating their efforts on the people and the devices that turn up. The data that gets recorded by a fixer is their description of the situation at the time. Our participants would read this "problem" text and judge whether it fitted any of the "fault types" that were presented.
